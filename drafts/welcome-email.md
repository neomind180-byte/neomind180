Email 1: The Welcome (Instant)
Subject: Welcome to NeoMind180 | Your first 180° starts here

Hello,

I am so glad you’ve decided to move from overthinking to clarity. Neo is ready for you.

Your journey with NeoMind180 is built on a simple premise: you are not your thoughts; you are the one observing them.

Your First Step: Head to your dashboard and start an 'Understand' session. Simply tell Neo what is clouding your mind right now.

Rethink. Rewire. Renew.

Email 2: Mastering the Flow (Day 2)
Subject: The 5-Phase Logic: How it works

Hello,

Yesterday you took your first step. Today, I want to explain why Neo works the way he does. We use a 5-phase grounding flow:

Breathe: Slowing the heart rate.

Notice: Naming the heavy thought.

Separate: Stepping back from the emotion.

Understand: Neo’s 180° shift in perspective.

Choose: Aligned action.

Have you tried a 'Micro-Reset' yet? They take less than 60 seconds and are perfect for busy moments.

Email 3: Deepening the Practice (Day 7)
Subject: Enough thinking. It’s time to deepen your support.
