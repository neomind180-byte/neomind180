Subject: [Circle Invite] Our next deep-dive session (7 days away)

Hello,

I meet when the collective energy is right—and I feel it is time for us to gather.

Our next Community Circle will take place exactly seven days from today.

The Focus: [Insert Theme, e.g., 'Moving past the mid-month stall']

During this session, I will lead a live 180° shift exercise and open the floor for shared reflections. As a Yearly Growth member, your private access link is below:

Before we meet, I invite you to use Neo to explore one specific area of overthinking you've noticed this week. Come prepared to share what you've realised.

Rethink. Rewire. Renew.
